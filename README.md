## What is the purpose of this app?

I built this app to get experience working with the KOA javascript framework. I read that it was similar to Express, so I wanted to build something simple to understand it better.

## What is KOA?

It is a server-side framework for Node.js. KOA was created by the same creators of express, another popular back JS framework.

KOA provides a minimal interface for developing apps and API’s.

## Extremely Lightweight

- Smaller footprint than any other Node.js framework including Express.
- Thinner and better middleware.
- You have the option to extend the framework with added modules.

## Modern Framework

- KOA is bull ES6+ and promotes modern JS syntax.
- Uses generators and async/await.
- Helps devs create apps that remain relevant over a long period of time.

## Request & Response

- KOA uses a req and res object on top of the standard vanilla JS request and response.
- It accelerates HTTP server development by providing additional functionality.
- Encapsulates req/res into a single object using context. This helps devs build API’s more efficiently by using a number of helpful methods.

## Common KOA Add-on Modules

- _KOA Router_ - KOA does not come with a built in router as it is very minimalistic. KOA-router is a simple routing module.
- _KOA EJS Templating_ - Easy to use template engine to display views & layout. Of course you can use a frontend framework as well.
- _KOA Body Parser_ - Parse incoming data.

## Overall Advantages of KOA

- Very small footprint but easily extended
- Fast and efficient.
- Modernized syntax.
- Enhanced HTTP req, res
- Simple to learn if you know Express
